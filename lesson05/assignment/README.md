# Assignment 05 - CSS Grid & Flexbox

This layout will/can be used as a page layout for one of your final course project pages (to be copied over later). If you'd like to expand upon or modify this layout for your project, feel free. Create using the content (text, images) that you want in the final site.

### Required setup if not already installed (it should be)
- Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html)
- [Design Spec Link](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/8117a5c5-ebde-471d-7eb0-c67b3578aeba-f726/) (Doesn't require download/install of XD)

### To get started:
-	In your forked repo, create a new branch off of master called `lesson-05` or similar
-   Navigate to the root folder of this assignment within terminal in your fork, `lesson05/assignment`
-   Run `npm install`
-   Run `npx gulp`
-   Start working with the files, browsersync will watch your scss/HTML files and reload on changes
- 	Find the XD/PNG of the mockup component in the `ref` folder.
- 	Please keep using SCSS and BEM when building components/layouts
- 	Build the component using CSS Grid for the layout and flexbox for aligning content
- 	The provided design will give you the general layout, please use Grid areas for the content sections (header, nav, sidebar, content, footer)
- 	Fill in each area's content with something so that the layout resembles the mockup. This can be the actual planned content for your project's page, or some dummy text and images. Remember, when building out fluid/responsive layouts, giving components and content areas fixed heights is something to generally avoid -- let the content fill the space, and use padding/margin for whitespace
- 	Add dummy nav items and use flexbox to align them, at least five as shown in the design
- 	**Bonus:**  Add media queries or advanced grid techniques to make the nav responsive.
- 	**Extra Bonus:**  Use grid templating and try out the repeat and autofill techniques

### To Submit:
- Create a Pull Request for your assignment branch to your forked master
- Submit the link to your pull request in your assignment submission box
- Once assignment is graded, merge the Pull Request
